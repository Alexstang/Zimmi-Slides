## Smart Contracts 

### Origin

"The basic idea of smart contracts is that many kinds of contractual clauses (such as liens, bonding, delineation of property rights, etc.) can be embedded in the hardware and software we deal with" - [Nick Szabo](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)

## Smart Contract Limitation

"Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the till should be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism)" - [Nick Szabo](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html)<br> ![VendingMachine](https://github.com/Alexstang/Zimmi-Slides/blob/master/VendingMachine.jpg)
 
 ## DAOHack
 
 * The DAO: smart contract raised $160M
 * ~33% in hacked “child-DAO”
 * [slock.it](https://slock.it/) and Vitalik [proposed a plan to unwind The DAO.](https://medium.com/@stephantual/a-fork-in-the-road-c3c267b9ff31#.o6r6l261a)
 * This fork was declared an improper, possibly illegal, intervention in a valid contract.
 * "code is law"

 # Literate Programming

 Instead of imagining that our  main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
\- [Donald E. Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf)

## Literate Smart Contracts

* Code block under each clause
* Definitions first
* Public keys for parties
* Detached signature blocks 
* Extract Code for Source Files <br> * Compile source for binaries, if necessary
* Recommend Markdown or Tex

# Consensus & Governance

### *By: Ira Miller <br> For: PanaFintech*

## What is it?

“What, then, is the government? An intermediary body established between the subjects and the sovereign for their mutual communication, a body charged with the execution of the laws and the maintenance of freedom, both civil and political.”
― Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract

## Guld Consensus

### *Proof of Labor (PoL)*

### Protocol

* Records stored in a DAG (start w/ git)
* Records kept in organized "blocktree" taxonomy
* Each record has official "observer"
* That observer's perspective is "truth"
* Observers identified by PGP key

~Proof of Observation~

## The Blocktree

"The blocktree is a symbolic representation of quantifiable reality from the perspective of one or more observer." - [Ira Miller](http://iramiller.com/)

## Next Week <br> Guld

### Browser

A cross-platform browser to create and experience the blocktree with other guld members.

### Guldcoin <br> (XGC)

A new digital token, which is spent to register a name on the blocktree.
